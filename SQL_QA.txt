SELECT * 
FROM "product_size"
WHERE sale_price > regular_price

4) Identify the paintings whose asking price is less than 50% of its regular price

SELECT * 
FROM product_size
WHERE (regular_price - sale_price) >=  regular_price/2;

5) Which canva size costs the most?

SELECT cs.label as canva, ps.sale_price
FROM product_size ps
left join canvas_size cs on cs.size_id = ps.size_id
ORDER BY sale_price DESC  LIMIT 1;



6) Identify the museums with invalid city information in the given dataset

SELECT * 
FROM museum
WHERE city REGEXP '^[0-9]';


7) Find the invalid days from museum_hours.

SELECT museum_id, day 
FROM museum_hours
WHERE day NOT IN ('Sunday', 'Saturday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Monday', 'Friday');

UPDATE museum_hours
SET day = 'Thursday'
WHERE day = 'Thusday';

9) Fetch the top 10 most famous painting subject

SELECT subject, count(work_id) AS no_of_paintings, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC) AS ranking
FROM subject
GROUP BY subject
order by count(work_id) DESC LIMIT 10;

10) Identify the museums which are open on both Sunday and Monday. Display museum name, city.

SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY m.name) AS number, m.name as museum_name, m.city, m.state,m.country

JOIN museum_hours mh1 ON m.museum_id = mh1.museum_id AND mh1.day = 'Sunday'
JOIN museum_hours mh2 ON m.museum_id = mh2.museum_id AND mh2.day = 'Monday';

11) How many museums are open every single day?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT museum_id
FROM museum_hours
GROUP BY museum_id
HAVING COUNT(day) = 7) X;

12) List of museums which are open on every single day

SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY name) AS s_no, name, address, city, state, country
FROM museum
WHERE museum_id IN

	FROM museum_hours
	GROUP BY museum_id
